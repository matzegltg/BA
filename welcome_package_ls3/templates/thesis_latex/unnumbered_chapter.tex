\addchap{A chapter that does not get enumerated}
This chapter is part of the index, but is not enumerated.

And another equation in a new chapter - obviously, because the chapter is not enumerated it fucks up the numbering as the scheme is (chapter\_number.equation\_number):
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:trig}
    \sin (\alpha)^2 + \cos (\alpha)^2 = 1
\end{equation}

So if you really need unnumbered chapters with equations the easiest way to fix this may be to use consecutive equation numbers.
See the source and uncomment the `chngcntr` package.

And here we have a reference to an equation from the previous chapter: equation ~\vref{eq:circle}.
When using the `hyperref` package, clicking on the reference should send you to the correct equation.

Test.
